## Topic: Version Control using Git and GitHub: Commit, Branching, Merging, and Pull Requests

### Steps:

#### Set Up a Local Git Repository:
1. Initialize a new Git repository in your local development environment.
2. Create a new text file named `README.md` and add some initial project description or any content you choose.
3. Stage and commit this file with an appropriate commit message.

#### Create a New GitHub Repository:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub with a meaningful name.
2. Link your local repository to the remote GitHub repository (using `git remote add`).
3. Push your local commits to the GitHub repository.

#### Branching:
1. Create a new branch in your local repository called `dev`.
2. Switch to your new branch and create a new file called `hello.txt`.
3. Commit the changes to your new branch.

#### Pushing the New Branch:
1. Push your new branch to GitHub, making sure it's reflected in your remote repository.
2. Verify that your new branch is visible on GitHub.

#### Create a Pull Request:
1. Once the new changes have been committed and pushed, go to your GitHub repository.
2. Open a pull request to merge your new branch into the main branch.
3. Provide a description of the changes you made in the pull request.

#### Merge the Pull Request:
1. After reviewing your pull request, merge the pull request into the main branch on GitHub.
2. Ensure that your local main branch is updated after the merge.
